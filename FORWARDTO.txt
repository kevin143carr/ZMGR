This is how FORWARDTO should work.
1.  ZMGR is in receiving mode.
2.  ZMGR receives a file with the .FIL extension.
3.  The .FIL should have a name associated to it like MELBA.FIL.
4.  MELBA would be the name of the computer this file is going to.
5.  If current ZMGR is not computer named MELBA it will forward on to the next computer
    by uploading it to its upload port.
6.  The next ZMGR will receive it.  If it matches the .FIL name then it would keep
    the file, otherwise it would forward onto its upload port.
